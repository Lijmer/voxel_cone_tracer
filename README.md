# voxel_cone_tracer
This is a protoptype voxel cone tracer where the only goal was to get it to work.
The code is very slow and messy, and also to my knowledge only works on NVIDIA driver version 355.98

Feel free to use this code to learn from. A report that I had to write as part of my school assignment can be found in the doc folder, which might be able to help you as a guide.
